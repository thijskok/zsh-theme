# Mnml Oh-My-Zsh Theme

A minimal theme inspired by [Cobalt2](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm).

## Prerequisites

* [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
* [Powerline fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts). Make sure you select one of them in the Terminal settings, I recommend *DejaVu Sans Mono*.

Furthermore, I recommend using the [Solarized Dark theme](https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized) for Terminal.app on OS X.
